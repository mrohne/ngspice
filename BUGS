This file contains a list of known but not yet fixed bugs in ngspice.
===========================================================================

How to submit a bug report:

There are two methods to report a bug you have discovered in ngspice:

    * Bug tracker: This is the preferred method of reporting a bug. 
      Using the tracker on Sourceforge.net site will make your report 
      open by everyone and the chances of finding a fix will increase.
    
    * ngspice-devel list: If you are a member of this list, you can write 
      directly to the developers' list. Do not subscribe to the list only 
      for sending bug reports.

Before sending a bug report please note: all information you send to the bug 
tracking system or on the mailing lists is public. If you need to send 
sensitive information, send them to a developer directly but still write non
sensitive data on the bug tracking system to keep track of bug history.

* return value:

  When ngspice is called in batch mode it returns 1 even if the simulations
  are run. The problem arises when there is a .control section but no
  .print, .plot or .fourier lines. Ngspice outputs:
  
    Note: No ".plot", ".print", or ".fourier" lines; no simulations run 
  
  and exits returning 1.
  
  Workaround: add -r <dummyfile> to the command line to avoid this.
